Console Hangman game
I love anime so the words are selected from anime shows I have enjoyed throughout the years
If you copy and download the source code exactly remember when running the code you have to run both files at the same time. Example: go run main.go words.go
If you do not want to run both at the same time please copy and past the words from the words.go file into main.go file or create your own word list.
Thanks for playing!
